# ü©∫ Breast Cancer Prediction Project

## üìñ Overview  
This project is a web-based application that classifies breast cancer as either malignant or benign using a machine learning model. It offers a modern, responsive interface that allows users to input medical features and receive immediate predictions powered by a pre-trained ML model.

Built using React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS, the app ensures a fast, intuitive, and seamless user experience with clean design and real-time functionality.
